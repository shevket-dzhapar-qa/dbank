  @NegativeRegistrationCases
  Scenario Outline: Negative Case. As a Digital Bank Admin I want to make sure users can not register without providing all valid data.

    When User creates account with following fields
      |  title  |  firstName  |  lastName  |  gender  |  dob  |  ssn  |  email   | password   |  address  |  locality  |  region  |  postalCode  |  country  |  homePhone  |  mobilePhone  |  workPhone  |  termsCheckMark  |
      | <title> | <firstName> | <lastName> | <gender> | <dob> | <ssn> | <email>  | <password> | <address> | <locality> | <region> | <postalCode> | <country> | <homePhone> | <mobilePhone> | <workPhone> | <termsCheckMark> |
    Then the user should see the "<fieldWithError>" required field error message "<errorMessage>"

    Examples:
      | title | firstName | lastName | gender | dob  |   ssn   | email  | password  | address    | locality | region | postalCode | country    | homePhone  | mobilePhone | workPhone  | termsCheckMark  | fieldWithError |errorMessage                        |
